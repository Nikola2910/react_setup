- Simple app made using React JS where you can [add](http://i.imgur.com/7WfCWZ6.png) / [remove](http://i.imgur.com/GwYjSsA.png) or [edit](http://i.imgur.com/8bLyiIM.png) existing Users. Tooltips are added for better UX.
- When the add or edit option is clicked, a [popup](http://i.imgur.com/1CLeLFG.png) is opened.
- Each User shown in the app is rendered from Firebase collection.
- here is also a feature that [sorts](http://i.imgur.com/IBah4zD.png) Users by name form A-Z or Z-A.
